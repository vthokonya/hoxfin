# hoxfin Project

Hox Finance Service is a personal finance management app focusing on managing your
investment portfolio, company research and reporting.

Because here in Zimbabwe we have experienced one the worst hyperinflation episodes of
the 21st century, I have also added inflation when computing portfolio gains/loss

The app covers 3 areas:
1. Portfolio Management
2. Exchange & Broker Management 
3. Research
